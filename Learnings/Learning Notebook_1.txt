Visual Studio - Environment is used to create web or desktop applications using C#, HTML, any front end code.

		. Create a Database in SQL
		. Create C# middle ware code for CRUD operations on application
		. Get all necessary things to HTML and bind data to HTML elements to show in UI
		. Create Front end code like javascript, Angular etc.., for making application and UI as user friendly.

Tier Architecture: 3-Tier Architecture -GITAM is (1, 2, 3, N tier Architectures).

testing is direct user will do some changes in application and any issue(from front end, c#, HTML) it is in the same project

MSIL - Microsoft Intermediate Language - C#, F# - these languages convert to binary and get response in binary and change to the respected language.


We cannot create or add libraries related to Angular CLI - 

Asp.NET core this is used to create API's for web applications. - 1st step.
Angular is having capability to call API's and get result into UI. - 2nd step.

Create all the API's and call that Api's inside vs code with angular and get the results.

Testing will be separated.
 
First tester will test all API's if the values are coming or not. - Data
Second tester will test UI perspective and here they check first UI changes and then check if data is properly reflecting in UI or not.

Why Angular? 
Applications whose body is only rendering on click and header, footer of the page will remain same. This concept is called Single Page Application(SPA).

JavaScript is having feasibility for SPA but this is not component friendly.
JS will have div elements for changing or rendering the page.
Angular came up with a concept called component.

DataBinding

In Angular we have different type of data binding
interpolation - we bind data using {{}} braces inside Html tags. - One way data binding. Data comes from ts file to HTML file. 
But will not transfer from HTML file to ts file.
